# Safeguard
Was the programmer for project. Worked with a small volunteer team of about 30 people to create a tower defense type of game in Unreal 4.
I set up the crafting system, AI behavior, and combat system. since the team for project was volunteering the project didnâ€™t make it past the 
prototype phase a lot of functions, variables, and code is still placeholders.
